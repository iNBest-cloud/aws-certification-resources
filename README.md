## Guide

I‚Äôve just passed six certifications in two months I want to share how I did in case if anybody else finds it useful. I am happy to help anybody answering any questions you have. The certifications I did where:
* AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
* AWS Certified Developer - Associate (DVA)
* AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA)
* AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate (SOA)
* AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional (SAP)
* AWS Certified Machine Learning ‚Äì Specialty

Here are the resources I used:
* Started by reading the official exam guides from AWS and took note of all the additional resources (videos, whitepapers, FAQs, etc.)
* I did all the courses on "A Cloud Guru" related to each certification. They were an excellent high-level guide for the topics the examen covers, and they shed light on where to read more. I took notes from all the additional resources offered by A Cloud Guru as well.
* Do all the labs in "expert mode," there is no match to learn something than getting your hands dirty.
* Read all the forums of each certification and did the exam simulators. I re-tried for each simulator until I got 100%.
* Did a search on /r/AWSCertifications for each certification, sorted by upvotes, and read the experiences of past applicants.
* After having a general grasp of the concepts, I used my list of additional resources to deep dive into each service.
* From those resources, I found most useful videos from AWS from re:Invent (300, 400) and deep dives.

Here are my notes, I tried to give them as much order as possible to make them useful to other people, and most of it is copy and paste from the resources listed, you can download it from here:
